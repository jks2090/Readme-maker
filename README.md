## Readme Generator

# Purpose

To create a readme generator that passes user input into a readme template, and then creates a new readme file

# Method

The Readme Generator uses inquirer to pass user input into an array and then appends the data into the template. Then it writes all of the markdown generated from the template and data into a readme formatted file. 

# Demonstration

# Conclusion/End Result

The generator handles the user inputs gracefully, offers options for the licensing, creates links in the table of contents, and generates the readme file as expected
